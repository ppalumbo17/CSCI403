Project 5

Challenges:  I had a lot of challenges with this project.  The biggest challenge I had that made me feel like an idiot was that I was using executeQuery() for the INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE instead of just execute().  This was giving me a lot of database errors that I was really confused about until I finally realized that all my problems stemmed from five characters. <3 CS

Likes/Dislike:  I enjoyed this project and it taught me a lot about using databases in real applications.  I didn't enjoy not knowing what I was doing for such a large portion of this project until everything clicked.

Time:  I spent a lot longer on this project than I probably should have.

Help:  Stuart Farris helped me with some of my Queries.
