Project2 - CSCI403
1. Stuart Ferris helped me with problems 11 and 13.
2. At first it was hard to remember where everything went and when to use certain elements but as I progressed everything came together.
3. This assignment was a fun learning excercise.  Having a good knowledge of the Hogwarts Universe was good because I could tell when I did something right and when I did it wrong.
4. I spent about 5 and a half hours on this assignment in total.
